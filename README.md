This project is a basic HTML5 'ContactUs' Webpage structure with a seperate CSS style page for readability:

      - First at the top of the page we have the **Navigation Bar** with Home, About, and Contact: These are made to be responsive using Id's but the page is a simple outline so clicking wont take you to far. 
      
      - The next section is a **Contact Form** where the user can input their Name, Email, Message, how they found our site and submit their message. 
      
      - Next we have a **Table** with our products listed by Product Name, Price, and Quantity.  
      
      - Finally we have the **Gallary** or images which are placeholders. 
                - These are styled in CSS to flip so you can see the front and back of the image 
                  saving space and adding a cool animation.
### Requirements
- Use semantic HTML 
- Added comments for readability  
- CSS used for styling  
- Responsive design using Id tags for the Nav bar
